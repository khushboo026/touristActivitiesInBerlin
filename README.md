## Product requirements:

- At a minimum, we expect a search feature that lists activities based on user input.
- You should build at least one API endpoint which your frontend application can use to get data or search results.
- Based on the provided data, you can add additional features which you think may be useful for travelers.

If you'd like to build this step by step, you can follow this guidance:
- Start by creating the API endpoint
- Create a simple app which uses the endpoint to get data, search and display a list of activities
- Improve the visual display of the app and search results
